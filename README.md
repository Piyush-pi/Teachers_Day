# Teachers_Day #WebsiteDevelopment
I used technology and my learning and try to wish in a technical manner HAPPY TEACHER's DAY to all the teachers who supported me or helped me to achieve goals in my life.
Not only to my teachers but I salute to all the teachers who helped students at every phase of their life.

Here in this project i used basic of :
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap4
4. PHP
to build this website.

The above website's first simple page can viewed on below link : 
https://piyush-pi.github.io/Teachers_Day/
Rest you cannot access to more pages because this link doesn't support php and backend languages.
